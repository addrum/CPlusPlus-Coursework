Components tested:
	ostream & operator<<( ostream &os, const fraction &o)
	ostream & operator>>( ostream &os, const fraction &o)
-------

We have written the following code in main() of main.cpp to test fraction.cpp:
	fraction fr;
	cin >> fr;
	cout << fr << endl;

-------

The inputs we entered (one at a time) in the console were:
	213/2324
	4213/214324
	354123/234

-------

The outputs received were:
	213/2324
	4213/214324
	354123/234
-------
The result was that the numbers were recorded correctly and quickly.
